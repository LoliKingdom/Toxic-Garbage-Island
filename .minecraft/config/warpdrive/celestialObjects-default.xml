	<!--
	  An astronomical object or celestial object is a naturally occurring physical entity, association, or structure in the observable universe.
	  They can be a planet, a more abstract construct like solar system (space dimension) or the all mighty hyperspace.
	  Hyperspace is defined by its WarpDriveHyperspace dimension provider.
	  Space is a dimension with Hyperspace as its parent.
	  
	  This default configuration is fairly simple.
	  In practice, you can have several hyperspaces containing multiple spaces containing numerous planets, etc..
	  
	  When no dimension is defined, a celestial object is considered 'virtual'. An hyperspace can be virtual. A sun is (in most cases) virtual.
	  In theory, multiple planets can exists in the same Minecraft world (for example: The Twilight Forest exist on multiple planets in different star systems).
	  
	  celestialObject.id should be unique for each Celestial object.
	  When provided by WarpDrive, this is the world folder name instead of DIMxxx.

		  dimension.isBreathable: this is a boolean flag defining if ambient atmosphere is breathable. This only applies to planets; space and hyperspace are always non-breathable, obviously.
		  dimension.isHyperspace: this is a boolean flag defining if this an hyperspace dimension. 
		  dimension.gravity: this is the gravity simulation type. Valid keywords are 'none' (0.0), 'legacySpace', 'legacyHyperspace', 'normal' (1.0) or any value between 0 and 1.

		  skybox defines the sky rendering while inside a WarpDrive provided dimensions.
		  Those can be adjusted to your lore: in hyperspace, Babylon 5 is redish, Stargate is bluish, etc.
		  skybox.backgroundColor is self explanatory. Vanilla enforces plain black at max render distance.
		  skybox.starBrightnessBase is the minimum brightness of stars in the sky.
		  skybox.starBrightnessVanilla is how much of the vanilla star brightness is used. Space and hyperspace have no Sun, hence it's a fixed value.
		  skybox.celestialObjectOpacity is used for that eery feeling. 0 will completely hide celestial objects.
		  skybox.fogColor is the main color. Higher values increases the halo effect.
		  skybox.fogFactor is the fog opacity depending on local Sun position. Space and hyperspace have no Sun, hence it's a fixed value.

				  render defines several layers from surface to high atmosphere representing the planet.
				  By extension, if no render element is defined, then you won't see the planet from space.
			      
				  red, green, blue: together, they define a color mixing from 0.00 0.00 0.00 (black) to 1.00 1.00 1.00 (white).
				  alpha: transparency factor from 0.00 (invisible) to 1.00 (opaque).
				  texture: optional texture to use, can come from resource pack, vanilla or the mod itself.
				  periodU, periodV: optional texture rotation period over the planet, measured in seconds, defaults to 0 (disabled)
				  		Texture coordinates are defined along U and V axis (you can see them as X and Y axis in the context of the texture pixels).
				  		A periodU of 40 means the texture will do progressively shift along U axis, doing a full rotation in 40 seconds.
				  		A periodU of -80 means the texture will shift twice slower in the opposite direction. 
				  additive: optional blending function, defaults to false (multiplicative)
				  		Blending is the mathematical operation to mix existing pixel (previous layer or sky background) with the new one.
				  
				  In most cases, you want the first layer to be alpha="1.00", or the players will see the sky through the planet.
